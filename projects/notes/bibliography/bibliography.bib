    abstract = {A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically.
      Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two ``function
      spaces,'' and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into
      the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication
      theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth
      and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate
      of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is
      perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of ``ideal''
      systems which transmit at this maximum rate are discussed The equivalent
      number of binary digits per second for certain information sources
      is calculated.},
