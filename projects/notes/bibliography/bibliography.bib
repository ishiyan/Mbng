    abstract = {A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically.
      Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two ``function
      spaces,'' and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into
      the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication
      theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth
      and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate
      of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is
      perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of ``ideal''
      systems which transmit at this maximum rate are discussed The equivalent
      number of binary digits per second for certain information sources
      is calculated.},

  abstract  = {Financial markets are not predictable, let alone controllable.  The one thing traders and investors can control is their trading tactics, where some can have higher probability of profitability than others.  This book explains, by using phase analysis, why some of the indicators, and trading tactics would work better than others, and why some indicators and trading tactics would perform poorly.  Emphasis is placed on Awesome Oscillator and Accelerator Oscillator, which are based on Simple Moving Average, a popular tool employed by traders. They are then compared to Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and MACD Histogram (MACDH), which are based on exponential moving averages. By varying the parameters of MACD and MACDH, one can change the phase or time delay, and possibly make a larger profit.

This book is for practitioners, and includes all MATLAB programs used in the book.},

               analysis is again emphasized for the characterization of
               technical indicators employed by traders and investors. New
               indicators are created. Mathematical analysis is applied to
               evaluate the trading methodologies practiced by traders to
               execute a trade transaction. In addition, probability theory is
               employed to appraise the utility of money management techniques.
               The book: identifies the faultiness of some of the indicators
               used by traders and accentuates the potential of wavelets as a
               trading tool; describes the scientific evidences that the market
               is non-random, and that the non-randomness can vary with respect
               to time; demonstrates the validity of the claim by some traders
               that, with good money management techniques, the market is still
               profitable even if it were random; and analyzes why a popular
               trading tactic has a good probability of success and how it can
               be improved.},
